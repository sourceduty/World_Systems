### Example Usage

<details><summary>Example Starlink Satellite Internet Constellation Simulation</summary>
<br>

To simulate Starlink's satellite internet constellation, we need to break down the simulation into various components that accurately represent the system's structure and behavior.

```
import numpy as np

# Orbital Parameters
orbital_altitude = 550  # in kilometers
orbital_inclination = 53  # in degrees
num_satellites = 1584  # Number of satellites in this orbital shell
earth_radius = 6371  # Radius of Earth in kilometers

# Calculate the orbital radius
orbital_radius = earth_radius + orbital_altitude

# Simulate positions of satellites in the orbital plane
# For simplicity, we'll assume satellites are evenly distributed in a circular orbit

satellite_positions = []
for i in range(num_satellites):
    angle = (360 / num_satellites) * i  # degrees
    x = orbital_radius * np.cos(np.radians(angle))
    y = orbital_radius * np.sin(np.radians(angle))
    satellite_positions.append((x, y, 0))  # Assuming a simple 2D plane for now

# Print the first 10 satellite positions
for i, pos in enumerate(satellite_positions[:10]):
    print(f"Satellite {i+1}: Position (x, y, z) = {pos}")
```

This code simulates the positions of 1,584 satellites in a single orbital shell with an altitude of 550 km and an inclination of 53Â°. It calculates the position of each satellite assuming they are evenly distributed in a circular orbit and prints the positions of the first 10 satellites.
